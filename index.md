title: Efficient and Practical Purchase Recognition System for Unmanned Vending Machines
---

## Abstract

Unmanned vending machines are emerging as a promising retail service that meets the growing demand of consumers for contactless and efficient shopping experiences. Unlike open retail spaces, vending machines confine interactions to a predefined area, thereby constraining the range of consumer actions and enabling more reliable interpretation of behavior. In this paper, we present a novel real-time purchase recognition system designed for unmanned vending machines. The proposed system detects hands and items from two fixed cameras and tracks the detection results to determine whether the items are purchased or returned. For accurate recognition under unpredictable hand movements and occlusions, we introduce tailored detection and tracking methods. 
Moreover, for practical deployment, we implement the unmanned vending machine with a locking door and a payment kiosk. This setup updates a virtual shopping cart based on recognition results, enabling convenient and contactless checkout. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves outstanding performance and operates in real-time, validating its effectiveness and practicality for unmanned retail services.
